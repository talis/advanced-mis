Eventually, [Application Data]({{ site.baseurl }}/topics/app-data.html) will be updated automatically for you into Advanced MIS, once per week.

At the moment, to update application data you must push it from Aspire manually. Log into Aspire as a System Administrator, and in the "Admin" menu choose "Advanced MIS". From here you will be able to invoke the "Push data now" option.

To push data from Talis Aspire Digitised Content (digitisation requests) please raise a support ticket.
