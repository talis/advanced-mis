body_class: timeseries
---

Timeseries data differs from the [raw]({{site.baseurl}}/topics/raw.html) data in that it is grouped
by a number of dimensions and then rolled up into a sliding window. This compresses the amount of data
significantly, which is useful for dashboarding and trend analysis.

There are several different views representing different sliding window lengths and history:

1. `f_event_timeseries_1hr`
    - where the event counts and sums are per hour
1. `f_event_timeseries_24hr`
    - where the event counts and sums are per day
    - up to 36 months historical data
1. `f_event_timeseries_24hr_last_3_months`
    - where the event counts and sums are per day
    - up to 3 months historical data
1. `f_event_timeseries_24hr_last_6_months`
    - where the event counts and sums are per day
    - up to 6 months historical data
1. `f_event_timeseries_24hr_last_12_months`
    - where the event counts and sums are per day
    - up to 12 months historical data

Each sliding window has its own data retention policy [which is documented here]({{site.baseurl}}/topics/limits.html). Data ages out on a daily basis, so 3 months ago is 90 days from today's date.

Both tables share a common schema, with up to four `dimension_*` columns available. The definition of
these columns depends on the `event_class` in question and is documented in detail below.

### All rows

| Column | Datatype | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `uuid` | `VARCHAR(64)` | Unique identifier for this event aggregation | |
| `event_class` | `VARCHAR(128` | Class of event - see below for `property_*` field mappings | `list.view` |
| `time_window` | `TIMESTAMP` | Start time of the window | `2018-05-23 15:00:00.0` |
| `arrival_time` | `TIMESTAMP` | Usually the same as `time_window`, but could be +1 period for events that arrive late. | `2018-05-23 15:00:00.0` |
| `dimension_*` | `VARCHAR(128)` | Where `*` is value from `1` through `4`, definitions vary by `event_class` | |
| `event_count` | `INTEGER` | Number of times this event occurred within the window | `5` |
| `event_sum` | `INTEGER` | Some events can also aggregate a sum, which is a running total of a numeric field in the event itself, during the window. Otherwise `0`. The unit of this value will depend on the `event_class`.  | `3215` |

#### Possible values of `list.entry_point dimension_3`
The value can be split on a colon (`:`) into parts. Each part has a different meaning. In an SQL query you might use these values like this:

```redshift
select
    split_part(dimension_3, ':', 1) as view_mode,
    split_part(dimension_3, ':', 2) as launch_method,
    sum(event_count)

group by view_mode, launch_method;
```

### Events with class `list.item.click`

Only available when using new list view and new list edit from November 2019 onwards.

### Events with class `list.item.view`

<span class="deprecated">DEPRECATED</span> instead, see `list.item.click`

| `dimension_2` | List's Globally Unique ID, can be joined to [`public.f_rl_lists.guid`]({{ site.baseurl }}/topics/lists.html)   | `DE53F159-8AE9-F8D4-6518-263DED7D56E9` |

<a name="list-item-external_link-click"></a>

### Events with class `list.item.external_link.click`

External link clicks are triggered from the reading list and signal an intention of a user to go and view the thing clicked on. They don't necessarily mean that they go there, get past authentication and actually view the destination.

For example, they might click then immediately hit the back button if they didn't mean to actually go through and view. Or if they are not a logged in user, they may have been browsing the list but then not been able to actually view the digitisation when presented with a login challenge.

It is best to think of an external link click as an expression of desire to view a particular type of item, rather than a count of actual views.

| Column | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `dimension_1` | The tenancy short code | `broadminster` |
| `dimension_2` | List item's Globally Unique ID, can be joined to [`public.f_rl_items.item_guid`]({{ site.baseurl }}/topics/items.html)   | `DE53F159-8AE9-F8D4-6518-263DED7D56E9` |
